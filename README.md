## :rocket: Why

I've decided to work on this challenge as a way to go for a *hands-on*  on a "real world" project.

## :package: Used technologies

This application was built using `npx create-react-app` with the `--template=typescript` flag to set the *Typescript* stuff.

* [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios): Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js
* [styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components): Visual primitives for the component age. Use the best bits of ES6 and CSS to style your apps without stress :nail_care:
* [polished](https://github.com/styled-components/polished): A lightweight toolset for writing styles in JavaScript
* [react-icons](https://github.com/react-icons/react-icons): SVG react icons of popular icon packs
* [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html): Using state and other React features without writing a class
* [unform](https://unform.dev/): Unform is a performance focused library that helps you creating beautiful forms in React with the power of uncontrolled components performance and React Hooks.

## :computer: Getting started
